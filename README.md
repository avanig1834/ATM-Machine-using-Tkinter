# ATM-Machine-using-Tkinter
## Introduction
The ATM is an automatic banking system that enables users to
manage their accounts efficiently and quickly. It allows us many
features like withdrawal, deposit, personal details, etc. Moreover,
there is no need to be physically present at a bank to perform desired
operations. It provides extra security as each user has a unique PIN,
which is not shared or disclosed to any third person. We only need
an ATM card that can be used in an Automated Teller Machine for
performing transactions, updating personal details, etc.

## Requirements:
We have used Python language in our project. The IDE used for
writing codes is Visual Code. We made a Graphical User Interface
to depict the working of an ATM Machine. It is more convenient and
interactive. Libraries must be added to the code to make GUI, and
we used the TKinter library. It is a standard GUI library for Python
language.

## Concepts used:
1) OOPS using python
2) GUI using Tkinter
3) Use of Functions
4) File Handling in Python
